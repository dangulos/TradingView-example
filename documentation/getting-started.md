# Getting Started

## About this tutorial

TradingView Charting Library is a powerful instrument for displaying financial data. It has different technical analysis tools including about 100 indicators and more than 70 drawings. Under the hood it can process and display dozens thousands of data points, build custom resolutions and compare data from different time zones.

After reading this tutorial you will know how to connect data to the Charting Library, including streaming of real-time data.

As an example, we will connect the Charting Library to CryptoCompare which provides data from different crypto exchanges via a single API.

The tutorial is split into three parts: setting up the widget, integration of historical data and realtime updates using WebSocket.
